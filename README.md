Student: Ultan Ó Móráin

The public facing repository for my final year project submitted in partial 
fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of B.A. (Mod.) Computer Science. 

**code/** 

Contains the code for the Android application. To run the application using 
Android Studio, ensure your hardware is supported and give the application 
permission to access the camera. Select an example image from data-set/ 
and preload it into the applications local storage. A suitable example image 
is data-set/dipped/JPEG_20200309_04_02.jpg. Once this is done, run the application. 
If difficulties are encountered, refer to the 
[Android Developer Website](https://developer.android.com).
